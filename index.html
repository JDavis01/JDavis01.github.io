                    to Central Ohio to be closer to family. During that time I've
                    worked at UPS and Amazon and got my Associates in Computer Science 
                    at Franklin University. <p>I am currently working my way through We 
                    Can Code It's bootcamp program including Java, Spring MVC,
                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the near future looking for a

                <p>
                    In this project you are able to interact with pets and their 
                    shelter. The state and behavior of the subclasses are 
                    inherited from their super classes and act differently from 
                    each other based on their type. The pet types are organic cat and 
                    dog and robotic cat and dog. The organic pets are able to be fed, 
                    given water and played with. The robotic pets can be oiled and 
                    maintained. You can also admit pets into the shelter and adopt 
                    them from the shelter. Performing tasks causes the pet status 
                    levels to increase so you have to pay attention to what pet's 
                    needs to be met.

                <p>This is a project I worked while was going to school at Franklin
                    University. Essentially public and private keys were made by hashing
                    them so that they are now encrypted. Then you check to see if the data 
                    belongs to a user if the signature used with the private key matches 
                    the signature with the public key.

                <p>This is a project I did while looking for a job in Java that
                    was testing coding ability. In the project five cards are 
                    given to the player and computer randomly. The app then can 
                    determine who is the winner based on the best poker hand.

                <p> In this project we used Spring MVC to create models for reviews, hashtags, and 
                    categories with a corresponding repository. The controllers give the ability 
                    to create more models that are saved into a database through http requests.
                    Also, hashtags can be put into reviews and reviews can be put into categories.
                    You can see the changes being made through the REST client to see that
                    it is working.
